Plugins and Libraries

AmiBase is extended by plugins and libraries to provide additional functionality.


The difference between a plugin and a library:
    - a library doesn't have a user interface.
    - only one instance of a library is loaded at a time.

    - a plugin has a user interface.
    - multiple instances of a plugin can be active at the same time.

    both are loaded at runtime. Loading is delayed until the first time the plugin or library is required.


Plugins and libraries are loaded from the "plugins" folder.
Each plugin has a folder with the same name as the plugin.
Inside that folder is a file called "config.json" which contains the plugin's configuration.
If a library only consists of a single file, you can load it with the ".js" extension, saving you a http request for the config file.
