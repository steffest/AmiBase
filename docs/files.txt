a "File" is a structure point to a file and or its content.

There can be 4 pointers to where to get the file:

file = {
    file: pointer to binarystream with the content of the file. This is the case for example when "uploading" files
        from the local filesystem in the browser, of when reading from in memory filesystem like e.g. ADF
    url: when the file is accesible over a HTTP link
    path: When the file is on some AMIBase mounted file system (e.g. laozi)
    body: pointer to string when the content of the file is text instead of binary
}

An "attachment" to a icon structure is also of this type.

TODO: investigate if urls and paths can be reduced to the same thing. probably not really because files can have both a path and a url
TODO: investigate wheter text files can be some special form of binary file
